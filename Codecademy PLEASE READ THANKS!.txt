Dear Codecademy,

Here is my Colmar Academy project.

In index.html, you will note that I tried playing with Javascript to create a play-button overlay on the video, using a Font-Awesome icon. I think I need to learn a bit more about Javascript to implement this sort of thing properly.

The file named index2.html has a simpler implementation of the video using HTML5 'controls', with the play icon moved to the title of the video.

I have also included a separate note on my design choices.

All the best!

will
