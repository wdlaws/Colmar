I used Colmar's logos and the photographs supplied as inspiration for the design, colour and typography choices throughout the site.

Colmar has an interesting logo, combining a heraldic lion icon, which has a very traditional feel, with a clean, modern, sans serif typeface.

My design echoes this blend of traditional and modern aesthetic elements.

The base font is Ubuntu, which is a sans serif font with a modern feel, which is very easy to read. It will be suitable for longer pieces of text, such as blogs, in due course.

I have paired Ubuntu with Kreon. This is a serif font that looks more traditional and evokes the typography used in newspapers and heavyweight academic journals. However, it is only used for headings on the website, which prevents it from making the site feel too old-fashioned.

I have chosen a colour palette based around two core colours: dark grey and a darkish shade of teal. Teal is a calming colour and has a less severe visual impact than, for example, the shades of red used on Harvard's website. It also feels serious without being overly formal, and using lighter tones of the same colour can brighten up the design without coming across as too frivolous (see the background used in the 'Start Learning' section). Crucially, I have kept the number of colours in the palette to a minimum, so that the use of colour does not become distracting to users.

Finally, I have added a few subtle stylistic features that really lift the site, making it more engaging and visually unique. I've used curved edges on the diagonally opposite corners of images, which softens the overall appearance of the site's grid structure. Animated transitions have been added to interactive elements, delivering a pleasing user experience and encouraging interaction, but without being too showy or distracting.

I hope you like my design choices!
